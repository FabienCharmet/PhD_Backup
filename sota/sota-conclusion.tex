Virtual network migration has proven to be a topic where much work is left to be done from a security perspective. 
Formal languages dedicated to security often provide enough expressiveness to model a computer network, and different components related to its security vulnerabilities, and potential existing countermeasures.
However, SDN has yet to be modeled and so are its associated security properties.

We have also emphasized on the different security aspects of live Virtual Machine migration, as this process is widely used in the industry to provide uninterrupted service to end users. 
The attack surface of the virtual network migration process is very similar to the one exploited in the different works about Virtual Machines. This attack surface is also augmented by the security issues and challenges introduced by SDN. Nevertheless, the surface of a formal study of the VN migration process is barely scratched, and the security aspects are out of the scope of existing solutions.

Markov Decision Processes have rarely been used for resource allocation problem in a security preserving context. The Game Theory formalism has been difficult to exploit for a realistic usage in a real life environment, while Linear Programming remains limited for the representation of external interactions with the system. The formal solution a MDP is the set of optimal choices the defender should make when facing every possible situation,  Therefore, MDP can provide an answer to the RA problem but will remain complex as is, as long as an interpretation is provided to implement the formal results into a workable solution in the industry.
