The evaluation of our model has outlined several technical and modeling limitations:

First of all, the use of budgets as part of the MDP state is a root cause for the complexity in generating the MDP states. Indeed, these budgets act as a sort of ``identifiers`` that make the number of states grow exponentially depending on the budgets.
Secondly, the use of the duration of the migration in the description of each state of the MDP limits the capacities of the attacker. Indeed, the model implies that once the migration if finished the attacker cannot attack the infrastructure anymore. This raises the question ``What is a realistic time frame for the attacker to compromise the migration process and the virtual network ?".
In some numerical applications we have extended the duration of the migration to one extra iteration ($b_c = 40$ ). This has given the opportunity for the attack to extend his attack and reach more nodes.
Because the infrastructure is vulnerable to the attack model described in Section~\ref{sec:attack_model}, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker will keep attacking the infrastructure after the end of the migration. For instance, he may continue to establish his path if he could not complete it prior the end of the migration.
We can generalize the previous point to a global question: ``When representing the behaviour of an external element in the MDP, which aspect of the MDP should include the modeling?". While the formalism does not set any hard limitation, it is important to consider the realism aspect of the modeling with regard to practical scenarios and the threat model used. We represented our attacker in the definition of the states as well as the reward function, since rewards are based on the progression of the attack.
The use cases we proposed did not distinguish virtual networks between one-to-one mapping and one-to-many mapping. While arbitrary topologies are an important feature of a virtualization service, in our model we can easily alleviate this issue because physical nodes embedding virtual resources are part of the migration.
