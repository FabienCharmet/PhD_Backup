\label{sec:mdp-reqiorements}
We formulate the following requirements regarding the formalization of the MDP:\\
\textbf{Solution form: } The solution to the problem is the optimal set of nodes to monitor the infrastructure.\\
\textbf{Constrained budgets: } The defender has a limited financial budget and a maximum performance impact threshold.
This implies that the whole infrastructure cannot be defended.\\
\textbf{Specific attacks: } The attack on the migration process must be fine grained and target specific nodes.
