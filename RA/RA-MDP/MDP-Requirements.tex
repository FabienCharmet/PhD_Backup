We formulate the following requirements regarding the formalization of the game:\\
\textbf{Solution form: } The solution to the problem is a list of nodes on which the monitoring is deployed.\\
\textbf{Constrained budgets: } The defender has a limited financial budget and a maximum performance impact threshold.
This implies that the whole infrastructure cannot be defended.\\
