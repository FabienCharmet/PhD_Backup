\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\label{sec:mdp-reqiorements}
We formulate the following assumptions regarding the formalization of the MDP:\\
% \textbf{Solution form: } The solution to the problem is the optimal set of nodes to monitor the infrastructure.\\
\textbf{Constrained budgets: } The monitoring of the infrastructure incurs a performance impact. The infrastructure owner is willing to bear a limited impact on the operations. Therefore, we assume that the whole infrastructure cannot be monitored. \\
\textbf{Specific attacks: } The attack on the migration process is fine grained and can target specific nodes.
