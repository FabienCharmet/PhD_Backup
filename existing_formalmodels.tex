Formal models for network security cover a broad range of topics and applications.
We consider here the models providing a form of algebra to represent, to a certain extent different security properties.

\subsubsection{Confidentiality and authentication}
In computer networks, confidentiality and authentication of the communications were among the most important properties to measure and protect.
In~\cite{CSP-Schneider1996}, messages exchanged between users are described and characterized by a set of security properties.
The author uses the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) algebra to represent the different actors involved in a network communication, including a potential attacker.


\subsubsection{Alert correlation}
